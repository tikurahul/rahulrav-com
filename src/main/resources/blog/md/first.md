### A New Blogging Engine

I have been working on a new blogging engine, and this is my first blog entry using the new engine.

### The Tech

The blog uses `Ktor` which is a nice Kotlin based web framework. 
It also uses `TypeScript` and `Material Design Web`. Runs on Google App Engine. 

Keep an eye out for more posts.
