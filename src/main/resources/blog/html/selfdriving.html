<h2 id="adventures-building-a-self-driving-rc-car">Adventures building a Self Driving RC Car</h2>
<p>Having read some amazing books on Machine Learning, I had been looking for opportunities to apply ML from first principles in the real world. That was what got me curious about the wonderful <a href="https://docs.donkeycar.com">Donkey Car</a> project. The project is essentially a how-to guide to building your own RC car which can drive itself around a track using classicial control theory, computer vision or in my case Machine Learning. After attending a DIYRobocars meetup, I could not wait to build my own car.</p>
<p>I knew I wanted to do something different with <em>my</em> donkey car. So for my first build I chose an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FS83U42/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FS83U42&linkCode=as2&tag=rahulrav30day-20&linkId=82561a94ffc14365fe9ba794e61d0156">Asus Tinkerboard S</a>, a <a href="http://jevois.org/">JeVois</a> camera and <a href="http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/build_hardware/#parts-needed0">other</a> standard bill of materials.</p>
<p>I went with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FS83U42/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FS83U42&linkCode=as2&tag=rahulrav30day-20&linkId=82561a94ffc14365fe9ba794e61d0156">Asus Tinkerboard S</a> despite knowing that most members of the Donkey community were using a Rasbperri Pi 3B+. My main motivations were:</p>
<ul>
<li>More RAM (2 GB vs. the 1 GB in the Raspberry Pi)</li>
<li>16 GB of EMMC Flash (The Pi required the use of a Micro SD card which is not great for I/O)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose the <a href="http://jevois.org/">JeVois</a> camera because I liked having the freedom of doing some computer vision as well. The <a href="http://jevois.org/">JeVois</a> is a full-fledged Linux computer which has an on-board GPU as well. I ended up taking advantage of the camera by implementing a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1550147718793803">fast contrast stretching</a> algorithm to normalize for lighting conditions as a preprocessing step for the ML model.</p>

<p>Choosing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FS83U42/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FS83U42&linkCode=as2&tag=rahulrav30day-20&linkId=82561a94ffc14365fe9ba794e61d0156">Asus Tinkerboard S</a> required me to understand a lot about the <code class="prettyprint">donkeycar</code> framework. This was because everything in the documentation assumed that you were using a Raspberry Pi and in my case I was not. To make matters more difficult I had also chosen a different camera so I to write my own module to make things work.</p>
<p>I also realized that, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FS83U42/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FS83U42&linkCode=as2&tag=rahulrav30day-20&linkId=82561a94ffc14365fe9ba794e61d0156">Asus Tinkerboard S</a> had advantages over the Raspberry Pi 3B+, I had just enough headroom to run the stock Nvidia <a href="https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf">End to End Self Driving</a> model at a resolution of <code class="prettyprint">160 x 128 px</code>. </p>
<h3 id="hello-jetson-nano">Hello, Jetson Nano</h3>
<p>I wanted to experiment with more sophisticated models. As i was constrained by the CPU on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FS83U42/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FS83U42&linkCode=as2&tag=rahulrav30day-20&linkId=82561a94ffc14365fe9ba794e61d0156">Asus Tinkerboard S</a>, I decided to level-up using the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit">Nvidia Jetson Nano</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit">Nvidia Jetson Nano</a> is an <em>amazing</em> single board computer which has a real GPU with <code class="prettyprint">128</code> CUDA cores. Nvidia also has great software support including their Jetpack SDK, and they ship a customized version of Tensorflow <code class="prettyprint">1.13.1</code> for the Nano. </p>
<p>For the last couple of weeks, I was busy building a new car with the Jetson Nano. </p>

<p><img class="card"  src="/assets/images/donkey_side_view.jpg" alt="Side View" style="width: 32rem;" /></p>
<p>The Jetson Nano has been an absolute joy to use. I am running both the fast contrast stretching algorithms, as well as the ML model on the GPU. I compiled Open CV 4.1 for the Jetson Nano and contributed a <a href="http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/robot_sbc/setup_jetson_nano/#step-4-install-opencv">how-to guide</a> on doing that.</p>
<p>A few more tweaks after, and I had Donkey <code class="prettyprint">3.0.2</code> running really well on a Jetson Nano. I also added some more components to the bill of materials including a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MM68H8M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07MM68H8M&linkCode=as2&tag=rahulrav30day-20&linkId=b79b276e51d99f4b1992fde28ca7f4a8">PiOLED Display</a> which I added to the car to display some stats. The source code for this additional module is <a href="https://github.com/tikurahul/donkey/blob/donkey-v3-dev/donkeycar/parts/oled.py">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-race">The Race</h3>
<p>The race was a lot of run, and I managed to do my personal best which was a lap-time of <code class="prettyprint">13.1s</code> around the track. My 3-lap timing was <code class="prettyprint">37s</code>. My previous finish was <code class="prettyprint">27s</code> for 1 lap. (I have come a long way). </p>
<p>Here is a video of the race. The first one was my best, and in the second video I tried to make it go faster.</p>
