<h2 id="building-an-e-ink-calendar-and-a-ui-toolkit-along-the-way">Building an E-Ink Calendar, and a UI Toolkit along the way</h2>
<p>Having worked from home for the better part of the year, I recently started to work on a new project. Building a E-Ink based dashboard which would keep track of my meetings among other things. Given the always-on nature of the E-Ink display, this would help me better manage by schedule during a typical work-day especially given I tend to miss Google Calendar notifications <em>a lot</em>. </p>
<p>This is what the end result looks like:</p>
<p><img class="card mdc-card mdc-card__media mdc-card__media--16-9"  src="/assets/images/e_ink_end_result.jpg" alt="E-Ink Dashboard" /></p>
<p>The app here is showing the next 5 Calendar events for <strong>a demo Google account</strong>.<br />
Looks nice and simple, does it not ?</p>
<h3 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h3>
<p>I took an off-the-shelf approach for the hardware. I purchased an <a href="https://inkplate.io/">InkPlate 6</a> which was originally crowd-funded on <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/e-radionica/inkplate-6">CrowdSupply</a>.</p>
<p>The E-Ink display is from a recycled Kindle e-reader, which means its a pretty great display. It has 2 modes including a 2-bit per pixel gray-scale mode and monochrome. It supports partial updates in monochrome mode. The display is connected to a <code class="prettyprint">ESP 32</code>, with built-in WiFi. All we need to do is to hookup the display to a PC via a USB cable and power it on. The display also comes with a nice 3D printed enclosure. </p>
<h3 id="the-software">The Software</h3>
<p>The InkPlate 6 supports MicroPython, and recently the libraries powering the display were <a href="https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-micropython">opensourced</a>. This gave me a decent foundation to build on top-of.</p>
<h4 id="oauth2-support">OAuth2 support</h4>
<p>The first step to showing events from Google Calendar is to be able to complete an <code class="prettyprint">OAuth2</code> flow. I decided to use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/limited-input-device">device flow</a> given the limited input capabilities of the ESP 32. </p>
<p>MicroPython does not have any libraries that work with <code class="prettyprint">OAuth2</code>, so I decided to write one. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/pull/407">PR</a> that I eventually made to the <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib">micropython-lib</a> GitHub repo which adds support for this specification. This ended up being pretty straightforward, given my familiarity with OAuth2 (having authored <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-JS">this</a> library before).</p>
<h4 id="building-a-limited-ui-toolkit">Building a limited UI-Toolkit</h4>
<p>The <code class="prettyprint">InkPlate</code> has a decent <a href="https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-micropython/blob/master/gfx.py">Graphics</a> API, but rather than having to hard-code coordinates to render UI i decided to take minor detour and build a mini UI Toolkit from first principles based on the graphics primitives that were supported. I took a lot of inspiration from the <em>existing</em> Android UI View system and build a small subset of those APIs.</p>
<h5 id="measuring-text">Measuring text</h5>
<p>The first step was to be able to measure the text to be able to compute how much space <code class="prettyprint">text</code> with a given <code class="prettyprint">text size</code> would occupy on the screen. The <code class="prettyprint">InkPlate</code> uses bitmap fonts, so i ended up using a look-up-table for widths and heights for individual letters for a given size. It's an approximation, but it worked well enough for me to proceed to the next step.</p>
<p><img class="card mdc-card mdc-card__media mdc-card__media--16-9"  src="/assets/images/e_ink_step_1.jpg" alt="Step 1: Measuring text" /></p>
<h5 id="columns-alignment-and-padding">Columns, Alignment and Padding</h5>
<p>Now that I had text measurements I could start drawing some text in <code class="prettyprint">Columns</code> and <code class="prettyprint">Rows</code> (these are the containers supported by the  custom layout system). I managed to also implement <code class="prettyprint">padding</code> and text <code class="prettyprint">alignments</code>. Not perfect, but still pretty good progress. </p>
<p>The image below consists of a single <code class="prettyprint">Column</code> with a nested <code class="prettyprint">Row</code> and a bunch of <code class="prettyprint">Text</code> nodes in various alignments and sizes. The <code class="prettyprint">10px</code> box on top is a component called <code class="prettyprint">Spacer</code> which just occupies empty space on the screen.</p>
<p><img class="card mdc-card mdc-card__media mdc-card__media--16-9"  src="/assets/images/e_ink_step_2.jpg" alt="Step 2: Columns, Padding & Alignments" /></p>
<h5 id="columnar-layouts-and-alignments">Columnar Layouts and alignments</h5>
<p>Now that I had some basic building blocks, I decided to go further and implement more complex layouts. I implemented support for <code class="prettyprint">aligning</code> containers and fixed a lot of bugs when nesting containers. You can also see <code class="prettyprint">text alignments</code> within individual <code class="prettyprint">Column</code> containers working.</p>
<p><img class="card mdc-card mdc-card__media mdc-card__media--16-9"  src="/assets/images/e_ink_step_3.jpg" alt="Step 3: Columnar Layouts & Nested Containers" /></p>
<h5 id="supporting-images">Supporting Images</h5>
<p>I finally added support for <code class="prettyprint">Image</code> nodes to layouts. This is also when I started to add some much needed UI polish. </p>
<p><img class="card mdc-card mdc-card__media mdc-card__media--16-9"  src="/assets/images/e_ink_step_4.jpg" alt="Step 4: Supporting Images & Initial UI" /></p>
<h5 id="miscellaneous-features">Miscellaneous Features</h5>
<p>I also worked on other additional features along the way, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support &amp; configuration for time zones. The MicroPython runtime on the ESP 32 does <em>not</em> ship with a Time Zone database and the real time clocks only support UTC seconds after epoch. </li>
<li>Support for token caching &amp; persistence. This was a big feature because this would mean that I could serialize the <code class="prettyprint">auth state</code> on the device. This meant that I did not have to do the full <code class="prettyprint">OAuth2</code> dance every single time I started the app.</li>
<li>A small <code class="prettyprint">DateTime</code> library capable of formatting dates in a couple of different formats. </li>
<li>Support for <code class="prettyprint">Deep Sleep</code>. This would allow the device to conserve power by not having to do anything. The device would only wake up once every <code class="prettyprint">N</code> minutes to refresh the events in the <code class="prettyprint">Calendar</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>This project was a <strong>lot of fun</strong>. I learnt a lot, especially given that I did not intend to build a UI Toolkit when I started working on the project). The toolkit i built is janky, but it is an accomplishment, considering I have never built one before. </p>
<p>MicroPython was incredible to prototype with (despite lacking a graphical debugger). I would highly recommending picking up a board that supports MicroPython for your next hardware project. The MicroPython community (libraries + forums) is also pretty active and helpful</p>
<h3 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h3>
<p>All the source code that I wrote for the project is on <a href="https://github.com/tikurahul/Inkplate-6-micropython">GitHub</a>. The entry point is a file called <a href="https://github.com/tikurahul/Inkplate-6-micropython/blob/master/app.py"> <code class="prettyprint">app.py</code></a>. Bear in mind, that all of this code was written in ~ a week long period. I also plan on making some more minor improvements to the UI. </p>
