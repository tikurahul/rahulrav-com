### Local Development, and Writing a Blog

* Start the App Engine development server using `./gradlew run`.
* In another terminal run `./gradlew -t build` which creates a watch on all the `src`
  folders, and sets up live reload.
* From the `tools` directory run `npm run-script watch` to setup a watch on the `resources/blog/md`
  folder which is the input to the generator responsible in generating the HTML. Also update `manifest.json` to add blog metadata.
